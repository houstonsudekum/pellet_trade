# pellet_trade_fig
 short notebook to create a trade figure from comtrade API and eurostat data
 
 the eurostat trade data is not accessible via their API so we have the required data saved in the in_data folder; the in_data
 folder also conatins comtrade codes needed to get the wood pellet trade data from the comtrade API; the notebook will
 output an .svg and .emf to the out_data folder
